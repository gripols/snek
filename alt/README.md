## What Is This?
Bad habit of mine is to have refactored variants or unchanged
files in here. These files don't inherently affect the function
of the program, but they do cause disorder, which does cause
chaos. 

Oh, also my citations go here.

## Will You Fix It?
If I feel like learning more about git, sure.

# CURRENT FILES
